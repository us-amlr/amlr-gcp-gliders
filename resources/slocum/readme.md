# amlr-gliders slocum utilities

This folder contains utilities used to process slocum glider binary files. Specifically, it contains a shell script and associated binary files for converting and merging Slocum glider binary data files to ascii.

This folder is functionally a recreation of [kerfoot/slocum](https://github.com/kerfoot/slocum). logging.sh was copied directly from kerfoot/slocum, while processDbds-usamlr.sh is the same as processDbds.sh except for a couple of path updates. The current linux-bin binaries are from release 8_6 from https://datahost.webbresearch.com/
